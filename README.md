Developed an interactive Attrition Rate Dashboard in Power BI to monitor employee turnover across different departments, locations, and time periods.

Utilized Power Query to clean and transform raw HR data, ensuring accuracy and consistency for analysis.

Applied DAX formulas to calculate key metrics such as monthly and annual attrition rates, average tenure, and voluntary vs. involuntary exits.

Designed the dashboard with visual elements like line charts, bar graphs, slicers, and KPIs to enable detailed, real-time analysis.

Empowered HR stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by identifying trends, high-risk areas, and root causes of employee attrition.
